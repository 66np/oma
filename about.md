## why oma

explicit languages are known to enable users to have more control over their program (i.e. memory management), but come with extremely large learning curves. whereas implicit languages, while typically come with the advantage of smaller learning curves, are error prone and render more difficult to debug at times due to their weaker definitions. the benefit of oma is to offer the users to define their own control parameters while also providing the option to auto-implement definitions on the program to reduce labour overhead.
